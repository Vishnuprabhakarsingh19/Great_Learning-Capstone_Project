# Customer Churn Analysis - DTH/E-Commerce Industry

<i>The study of Customer Churn has become an essential part of the strategy of the DTH/E-Commerce service providers for expansion of subscriber base by retaining old customers along with adding new customers in order to survive in this very competitive market. It can cost five times more to attract a new customer than it does to retain an existing one. This research is focused on using Advanced Analytics for discovering the factors leading the customer churning on a granular level.

The dataset used for our analysis and model building was from a DTH service provider who was facing a lot of competition in the current market and it became a challenge for them to retain the existing customers in the current situation. Hence, the company wanted to develop a model through which they can do churn prediction of the accounts and provide segmented offers to the potential churners. In this company, account churn was a major thing because 1 account can have multiple customers. hence by losing one account the company might be losing more than one customer.</i>
